# Regex Gist (Tutorial)

This tutorial will explore how regex (short for: regular expressions) work and what they are.

## Summary

Briefly summarize the regex you will be describing and what you will explain. Include a code snippet of the regex. Replace this text with your summary.

The goal of this tutorial is to allow the reader to have a quick-reference guide to the basics of regex (also known as regexp). Regex is a sequence of characters that specifies a search pattern in text - they allow users to create search patterns that match, manage and locate text. As a result, regex are commonly used in search engines and find/replace dialogs of word processors.

Here is an example of regex code:

(?<=\/)\w+

*"Hello World" in regex
